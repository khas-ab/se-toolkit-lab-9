### Implementation plan
Diet plan app
A recipe manager that suggests meals based on your dietary goals, available ingredients, and nutrition targets.
     - Backend: FastAPI + PostgreSQL. Recipes (ingredients, steps, macros, tags like vegan/high-protein), meal plans, user preferences,
       shopping lists.
     - Web: Recipe browser with filters (calories, cuisine, prep time), weekly meal plan calendar, nutrition breakdown charts, auto-generated
        shopping list.
     - Telegram bot: /add "chicken breast, rice, broccoli" → logs ingredients you have. /suggest → recommends recipes you can make right now.
        /plan week → generates a 7-day meal plan. /shopping → sends a consolidated grocery list.
     - Agent: Natural language queries — "I need a high-protein dinner under 500 cal" or "What can I cook with eggs and tomatoes?" LLM
       matches intent to recipes, suggests substitutions ("no coconut milk? use heavy cream instead"), and adjusts portions. Cron job sends
       daily meal reminders and a weekly shopping list.
Diet plan app
#### Version 1:
Pure Web Application (FastAPI + React/Vue/HTML)  
This is the classic approach. All the functionality of the Diet Recipe Planner is moved to the browser.  
- Screen 1: Input form for products and goals (calories, diet).  
- Screen 2: List of generated recipes with cards and nutritional information.   
- Screen 3: Weekly food calendar and "Download shopping list" button.  
Plus: It's easy to visualize nutrient graphs (proteins/fats/carbohydrates) using libraries like Chart.js.  
#### Version 2:
Interactive Agent (via Terminal or Web chat)  
I will use NanoBot as the main interface.  
The user communicates with the AI agent directly through the NanoBot web interface (or a custom chat on the website).  
The agent "goes" to your PostgreSQL database, searches for suitable recipes, and provides a text-based response.  
Plus: This looks modern and technologically advanced, as you showcase how the LLM manages your application's data.
